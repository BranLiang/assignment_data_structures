Buckets and buckets of data!

## Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

### Accessing an item by index in an array
O(1) : For any sized array, only one step is need to find the item.

### Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
O(n) : Unshifting an array needs to reconstruct the array somehow. So it is linear size dependent.

### Pushing an item onto the end of an array
O(n) : The reason is the same as above.

### Upcasing a String
O(n) : The lager the string is , the more time it needs and the relationship should be linear.

### Reversing a String
O(n) : The reason is same as above.

### The Enumerable#each method
O(n) : The reason is same as above.

### The Enumerable#include? method
O(n) : It needs to find through the whole array.

### Finding the max of an array
O(n) : The reason is same as above.

### splitting a String
O(n) :

### Inserting a value to a Hash
O(1) :

### Retrieving the keys of a Hash ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
O(n) :
